# Chess-AI
This is a chess AI project that is written in Python, and a player can challenge the computer. The AI is designed with the Minimax algorithm that utilizes the Alpha-Beta pruning method, allowing it to go through all possibilities quickly and make strategic moves. The algorithm examines all potential moves, simulates future game states, and decides its actions by selecting those that minimize the opponent's best responses.

# Features:
- A potential user can operate chess with the AI: This feature is evident after a user sets a full chess game with the AI. </br>
- Minimax Algorithm: A smart strategy that goes through each move accounts for the opponents' responses, and only tries to make a plan that gives the player the best victory. </br>
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: The AI is made leaner by lowering the number of nodes in the search tree during algorithm execution, and this method makes the wait time of the AI perceptibly smaller. The AI is also making it a little bit more corrupt.</br>
- Chessboard Display: The game visualizes the chessboard as part of the game interface.</br>
- An action is only through a valid move: The program prevents invalid moves by either the player and the computer from happening.</br> </br>
